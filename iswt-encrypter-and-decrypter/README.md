# ISWT Encrypter and Decrypter
This is a simple tool with multiple functions related to encrypting and decrypting text.

Instructions provided within the program should be fairly self-explanatory for proceeding either with encryption and decryption. 

The random key generator generates keys by matching every character in the ASCII table with a random other character. A sample key file (generated with the random key generator) can be found among the files in the GitHub repository. Taking the format there as the basis, you can prepare your own key file and use it to encrypt or decrypt messages as you please.
