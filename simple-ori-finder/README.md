# Simple _ori_ Finder
This is a simple tool that finds the positions of ori for a given prokaryotic genome. The included E. coli genome can be used for debugging. It is based on the basic logic provided in Pavel Pevzner and Phillip Compeau's course, "Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)."
